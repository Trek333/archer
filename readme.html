<p>
When configuring the CEF to Archer mapping (cef_mapping), include the following...
</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>The name of the application (e.g. Incidents)</li>
    <li>The name of the tracking ID field (e.g. Incident ID)</li>
    <li>Separate entries for each field that should go into the CEF of an artifact</li>
</ul>
</p>
When done, your mapping will take the names of Archer fields and map them into the CEF of an artifact. It should look something like the following...
</p>

<pre>
{
    "application": "Incidents",
    "tracking": "Incident ID",
    "Status": "status",
    "Category": "category",
    "Details": "details",
    "Archer field name": "CEF name"
    ...
}
</pre>
<br>
<p>Where Status, Category, Details, etc. are fields that exist in your Archer Application that you would like to import. <br>
Certain field types and attachments from Archer are not currently supported.

If a field is specified both in the cef_mapping and in the excluded fields list, the field will be excluded and not ingested.
